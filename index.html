<h1>Welcome to Page Powell's Site!</h1>
<p>I am currently a Senior at SMU and an Majoring in Creative Computing with a Minor in Advertising. One of my favorite things to do is travel and spend time at the beach. I hope to one day
 visit most of the countries in the world. Another one of my favorite things to do is listen to music as I like a diversity of different genres such as Pop, RnB, Country, and Indie. I am interested
  in UX/UI Design and 3D animation and hope to continue learning more in the future!

<h2>Create Your Own Generative Art Below!</h2>

<p>
 Click in the empty space below to generate random shapes! Each time you mouse click anywhere on the screen, a random shape with a random color will appear. 
 Use the A key to increase or D key to decrease the shape size. You can also hold down the mouse click and drag to create duplicates of shapes and draw on the canvas!

let size = 50; //preset size

function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 500);
  background(245, 245, 220); // Sets the canvas background to beige so viewers can see it
}

function draw() {
  //not needed to draw but for p5
}

function mousePressed() { //when ever the mouse is clicked a random shape will appear
  drawRandomShape(mouseX, mouseY); // Draw a random shape at the mouse position

  if (key === 'd' || key === 'D') { // Checks if the 'D' key is pressed

  } else if (key === 'a' || key === 'A') { // Checks if the 'A' key is pressed

  }

  // Generates random RGB values for each shape generated

  let g = random(255);
  let b = random(255);
